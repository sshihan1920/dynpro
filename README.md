Program Status/Algorithm Description:
For this lab, we set out to demonstrate the benefits of dynamic programming through designing a program that makes change for any given amount of money. First we constructed an algorithm that accomplished this task without dynamic programming, however it was slow and grew slower (at a very fast rate) when trying to compute higher input values. To resolve this problem, we implemented a 2D array that kept track of partial solutions into the program. This new code severely cut the time complexity for the program, thus highlighting the importance of dynamic programming.

Ex:
For Input of 63
Number of Calls:
W/O 2D Array: 1154223045
With 2D Array: 253
